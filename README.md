## SQL Data analytics course
I Completed an in-depth [SQL course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA) focused on extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data across complex datasets to drive meaningful insights. Gained hands-on experience with joining tables, implementing CASE expressions for conditional analysis, using date and time functions (e.g., EXTRACT) for trend evaluation, and building Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries. Developed proficiency in crafting subqueries for multi-step analyses and leveraging set operations like UNION ALL for cohesive dataset integration. Applied these skills in 5 comprehensive projects, demonstrating my ability to handle real-world data challenges from data extraction to insight generation.
